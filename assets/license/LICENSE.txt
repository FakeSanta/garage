License

The licensing depends on whether you're using FullCalendar Standard or FullCalendar Premium.
FullCalendar Standard

The non-premium plugins and the fullcalendar bundle are released under the MIT license. This license permits a wide range of use, including free use in commercial projects, assuming all copyright headers are preserved.

FullCalendar Premium

The premium plugins and the fullcalendar-scheduler bundle have more complicated licensing. Their licensing depends on the type of use:
Commercial Use

For-profit companies and individuals intending to use FullCalendar Premium for commercial use must purchase a commercial license. This license allows source code modifications, but does not permit redistribution of modifications.

Non-Commercial Use

Registered non-profit organization (also known as "not-for-profit" or NGO) are able to use FullCalendar Premium with a free, non-commercial license. Governmental entities and universities are not covered by this non-commercial license. This license does not permit source code modifications.

If you meet the criteria for this license, you may begin using FullCalendar Premium with this license key:

var calendar = new Calendar(calendarEl, {
  schedulerLicenseKey: 'CC-Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives'
});

Use in GPLv3 open-source projects

Open-source projects that are fully GPLv3-compliant may use FullCalendar Premium freely under the GPLv3 license.

If you meet the criteria for this license, you may begin using FullCalendar Premium with this license key:

var calendar = new Calendar(calendarEl, {
  schedulerLicenseKey: 'GPL-My-Project-Is-Open-Source'
});

Use in other types of open-source projects

Open-source projects released under licenses other than GPLv3 can leverage FullCalendar Premium in the following way:

    Do not include FullCalendar Premium directly into your repository’s source code. Instead, use a package manager such as NPM or Yarn to reference the premium plugins as dependencies and have an install script initiate download.
    Do not hardcode any type of license key. Instead, leave the schedulerLicenseKey property undefined, as FullCalendar Premium is technically considered “unlicensed” at this point. This will cause a warning message to show on the widget.
    Provide a convenient way for the developer installing your app to enter their own license key. Either do this via a prompt in an install script, or through a well-documented config file.
